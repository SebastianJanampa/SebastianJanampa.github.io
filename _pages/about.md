Hi everyone,

My name is Sebastian Janampa. I am a PhD student at the University of New Mexico (UNM), where [Dr. Marios Pattichis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QjpKRaAAAAAJ&hl) supervises me. My research consists of reconstructing the 3D position of a specific group of students with respect to a reference from classroom videos. In addition to that, I am deeply passionate about transformers and their multiple applications, such as object detection, line segment detection, 2D and 3D human keypoints estimation, and camera calibration. My academic hobbies are reading recent published papers and reading their open-source code. 

Apart from school, I love swimming, a sport that taught me a lot about discipline, consistency, self-judgment, and fair competition. I also enjoy dancing salsa (a Latin dance), which helped me develop my social skills and avoid nervousness. I am also interested in male fashion because it is interesting how what we wear the first time we meet a person leaves a big impression of who we are.
